# Two-Type Theory of Humanity: Cognitive Structure Hypothesis

## 1. Basic Hypothesis

Human cognitive structures fundamentally comprise two distinct types:

### Hierarchical Type
- **Information Structure**: Hierarchical/tree structure
- **Characteristics**: Systematization, preservation of structure, orientation toward predictability
- **Strengths**: Knowledge accumulation, institutional design, long-term planning, precise construction

### Non-Hierarchical Type (Network Type)
- **Information Structure**: Network/graph structure
- **Characteristics**: Exploration, structural fluidity, orientation toward relationships
- **Strengths**: Adaptation, creativity, crisis response, pattern discovery

## 2. Four Quadrants Based on Cognitive Processing Priority

Four types emerge from the intersection of cognitive structure (hierarchical/non-hierarchical) × processing priority (verbal/physical):

### Type A: Logical-Verbal Systemizer (Hierarchical × Verbal Priority)
- Structuring linguistic knowledge, logic, and rules
- Related: ASD traits, verbal giftedness

### Type B: Artisanal/Kinesthetic System Builders (Hierarchical × Body Priority)
- Spatial/motor skills, procedures, precise construction
- Related: ASD traits, motor giftedness

### Type C: Flexible Linguistic Explorers (Non-Hierarchical × Language-Priority)
- Ideas, associations, linguistic improvisation, multiple perspectives
- Related: ADHD traits, verbal giftedness

### Type D: Physical/Intuitive Explorer (Non-Hierarchical × Body-Priority)
- Body sensations, situational awareness, impulsive actions
- Related: ADHD traits, kinesthetic giftedness

## 3. Reinterpreting Developmental Disorders

### The Essence of ASD
**The difficulty individuals with hierarchical cognition face when confronted with non-hierarchical elements (unspoken rules, fluid relationships, unstructured sensory experiences)**

- Social difficulties: Unspoken rules cannot be integrated into hierarchies
- Rigidity: A strong orientation toward structural stability and consistency
- Sensory Sensitivity: Overload from unstructured raw sensory data

### The Essence of ADHD
**Difficulty adapting to hierarchical society (planning, prioritization, fixed rules) by individuals with non-hierarchical cognition**

- Inattention: All nodes equally demand attention (difficulty with selective attention)
- Hyperactivity: Physical expression of network exploration
- Impulsivity: Absence of hierarchical inhibition (reflection → judgment → action)

### Reinterpreting ASD+ADHD Co-occurrence (AuDHD)
Some cases involve:
- **Core non-hierarchical cognition (ADHD)**
- **Acquired hierarchical cognition (ASD-like) for survival in hierarchical society**
- Result: Exhibits “symptoms” of both

## 4. Translation Costs and Asymmetry

### What Are Translation Costs?
The cognitive load incurred when communicating and adapting between different types of cognitive structures

### Asymmetry in Modern Society
- **Hierarchical Society**: Language, social institutions, currency, education, labor—all optimized for hierarchical structures
- **Translation Costs in Non-Hierarchical Systems**: Maximal (Constantly forced to convert to hierarchical terms)
- **Translation Costs in Hierarchical Systems**: Nearly Zero (No translation required)

### The Embodiment of Translation Costs
- Chronic headaches, incontinence, feelings of emptiness, burnout
- Labeled as “symptoms” in the medical model, but are actually **the bodily expression of structural violence**

## 5. Hierarchical Bias in Social Institutions

### Language
- Subject-predicate structure, abstraction-concreteness hierarchy, temporal sequencing through tense
- Non-hierarchical cognition apprehends the world prior to language

### Social Institutions
- Authority, class, property rights, law—institutionalization of hierarchical structures
- Non-hierarchical “relational networks” remain uninstitutionalized

### Currency
- Abstraction and stratification of value
- For non-hierarchical systems, currency represents a “disconnection of relationships”

### Education & Healthcare
- Curricula, diagnostic criteria, treatment protocols—hierarchical standardization
- Non-hierarchical systems are labeled as “disabilities” or “maladjustments”

## 6. Limitations of the Medical Model

### Assumptions of the Medical Model
- Hierarchical classification of disorders (DSM, ICD)
- Linear causality (cause → symptom → diagnosis → treatment)
- Standardization (reproducibility, predictability)

### Issues
- **Labeling deviations from a hierarchical society as “disorders”**
- Diagnostic criteria define “functioning within a hierarchical society” as “health”
- Most observers (physicians, researchers) possess hierarchical cognition
- Inability to structurally comprehend non-hierarchical internal experiences

### Hierarchical Centrality of the “Disorder” Concept
- Disorder = Disruption (Dis-) of the expected order (Order)
- This “order” refers to the functional demands of hierarchical society
- Non-hierarchical experiences are, by definition, inevitably labeled “disorders”

## 7. Segregation vs. Coexistence

### Problems with the Coexistence Model
- “Integration of diversity” is effectively **assimilation pressure**
- Hierarchical and non-hierarchical structures are **fundamentally incompatible**
- Coexistence actually demands a one-way translation toward non-hierarchical structures

### Proposal for a Segregation Model
**Each type lives in an environment optimized for its own cognitive structure**

- Spatial Segregation: Hierarchical cities vs. Non-hierarchical communities
- Institutional Segregation: Separation of education, labor, and economic systems
- Informational Segregation: Separation of communication and knowledge management styles

### Advantages of Segregation
- Significant reduction in translation costs
- Maximization of each type's capabilities
- Elimination of the violence of mutual “improvement” and “education”

### Designing Points of Contact
- Clear boundaries and translation protocols, not complete separation
- The existence of hybrid types (translators)
- Selective interaction (voluntary exploration, not forced coexistence)

## 8. Formation of Hybrid Types

### Formation Patterns
Some individuals possess both cognitive modes:

1. **Innate Hybrid**: Possesses both elements from the outset
2. **Adaptive Integration**: Originally one type, but acquired the other through environmental adaptation
3. **Defensive Integration**: Constructed the other type as a countermeasure against translation costs

### Structure of the Hybrid Type
- **Deep Layer**: Original cognitive type (innate)
- **Middle Layer**: Structure exploration and pattern recognition
- **Surface Layer**: Translation layer (acquired later)

### Role of the Hybrid Type
- Translator and mediator between both worlds
- A rare entity capable of explaining the necessity of sharp distinctions
- Creator of new languages and concepts

## 9. Reinterpreting Evolutionary Theory and Human History

### Problems with Conventional Evolutionary Theory
- The hierarchical narrative: “Increased fitness = acquisition of more complex hierarchical structures”
- Human history written solely from a hierarchical perspective

### New Hypothesis: Cognitive Niche Differentiation
- Humans achieved ecological success through the **coexistence of multiple cognitive types**
- Hierarchical: Dominant in agricultural, sedentary, accumulative societies
- Non-hierarchical: Dominant in hunter-gatherer, mobile, responsive societies
- Optimal solutions vary by environment

### Modern Society's Bias
- Since the Agricultural Revolution, hierarchical systems monopolized institutions
- Language, society, and currency are hierarchical inventions
- Non-hierarchical systems were marginalized and forced into “translation”

## 10. Considerations for Application

### Nature of This Hypothesis
- Constructed from a single case; verification is required for generalization
- Under refinement as a falsifiable scientific hypothesis
- Elucidation of the neuroscientific basis remains a future challenge

### Usage Considerations
- Not intended to label or fix individuals
- Use provisionally as a practical map
- Avoid overlooking individual complexity and fluidity

### Ethical Implications
- Shifting focus from “disability” to “differences in cognitive types”
- Aiming for societal restructuring, not individual treatment
- Respecting the dignity and autonomy of individuals involved
